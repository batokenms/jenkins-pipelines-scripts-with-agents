Using Jenkins agents, also known as build agents or build nodes, is vital when building artifacts for production for several reasons:

Resource Isolation: Jenkins agents allow you to isolate and distribute your build and deployment tasks across multiple machines. This helps prevent resource contention and ensures that production builds do not interfere with other Jenkins jobs or tasks running on the Jenkins controller (master) itself.

Scalability: By using agents, you can scale your build and deployment infrastructure horizontally. This means you can add more agents to handle increasing workloads, improving your ability to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently.

Parallel Execution: Agents enable parallelism in your build and deployment pipelines. You can run multiple build and test processes concurrently on different agents, which significantly reduces the overall time it takes to produce artifacts for production.

Platform Compatibility: Agents can be configured with specific operating systems, software versions, and hardware configurations that mirror your production environment. This ensures that your artifacts are built and tested in an environment that closely resembles your target production environment.

Isolation of Dependencies: Agents can be set up with isolated environments that include specific dependencies, libraries, and tools required for your builds. This isolation prevents conflicts between different projects and ensures that your production builds use consistent and compatible dependencies.

Security: Jenkins agents can be configured to run in secured and controlled environments. Access to production build agents can be restricted and audited, helping to protect sensitive production code and data.
